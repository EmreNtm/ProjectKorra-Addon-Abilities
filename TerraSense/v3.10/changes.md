TerraSense v3.10 is out. (Tested with Spigot and Paper 1.16.4)
https://projectkorra.com/forum/resources/terrasense-redone.369/

Added a config option to see all solid blocks with waves instead of seeing only earthbendable ones.
Added a config option to change EarthPulse, moving and falling waves to waves that follow the terrain like SeismicWave.
Added a config option to set sense duration. Sense duration is the duration you will keep sensing entities when they are not connected to earth anymore (Default is 750ms). This option is added to make TerraSense better in fights. Set it to 0 if you want to disable.
