- Code is made over from 0. Now it is more clean and most of the bugs are gone.

* To decrease lag, TerraSense now spawns client-side glowing magma cubes instead of spawning server-side glowing cakes.
* GlowAPI and PacketListenerAPI are no longer needed. ProtoclLib becomes required.
* Glow glitchs of GlowAPI no longer exist.
* Now you can sense earthbending while you are blind.
* New combo "SeismicWave" added.
