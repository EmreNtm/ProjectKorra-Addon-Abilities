Added 3 more config variables and made some optimization for pulses.

New config variables:
TimeBetweenPulsesForWalk: 5 //Same as TimeBetweenPulses but for only walk function.
TimeBetweenPulsesForSneak: 5 //Same as TimeBetweenPulses but for only sneak & blind pulses.
PulseShapePercentage: 20 //When the pulse ranges increase, pulses will start losing their shape and there will be holes in the shape. 
This variable between 0 - 100, prevents holes in the circle shape. 100 is lesser shape/higher lag. Percentage in the video and default is 20.
