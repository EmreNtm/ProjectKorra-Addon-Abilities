TerraSense has a new config variable that decrease pulse frequency and lag

Default:
TimeBetweenPulses: 10

10 means 10 seconds. Even if you jump, if the current server time is not dividible by 10 seconds, there will be no pulse.
If you increase this, pulse frequency will be lower but lag will be lower aswell.
