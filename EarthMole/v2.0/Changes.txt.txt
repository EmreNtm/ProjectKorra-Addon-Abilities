- Code is made over from 0. Now it is more clean and most of the bugs are gone.

* Stuck issue while you are going up is solved.
* Stuck handling is improved.
* A bug that makes you be able to walk overground is fixed.
* If there are obsticles in your way up, you won't try to go up and the move won't go on cooldown.
* Now you can look up and down to stop moving.
* Going up function works fine up to 64 blocks above you.
* While going up, you will dig 1 block wide instead of 2.
